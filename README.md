Hi, my name is Jaclyn Chiu and I just graduated from a  Master of Engineering in Data Science program at UCLA this past September 2023. In June 2022, I graduated from UCLA with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics. My fields of interest include technology, communication services, healthcare, and others. My programming skillset includes Python, R, Tableau, and SQL. As an aspiring data scientist and analyst, I hope to apply the newest statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms to derive actionable insights and growth for research and companies.
