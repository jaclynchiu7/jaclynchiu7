Hi, my name is Jaclyn Chiu and I am pursuing a Master of Engineering in Data Science at UCLA and expect to graduate August 2023. In June 2022, I graduated from UCLA with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics. My field of interests include healthcare and technology. My programming skillset includes Python, R, Tableau, and SQL. As an aspiring data scientist, I hope to apply the newest maching learning algorithms to advance technological devices.
